# IS2215-Bank-App
This is a project I made as part of an assignment from my 2nd year in BIS

The application allows the user to sign in with their account and either lodge money, withdraw money, or transfer money to another existing account

The application contains an Microsoft Access database, this hold the customer and bank account details, it also tracks all of the transactions that occur in the app

# Names & Passwords
To use the application you must sign in with a name and password. The premade one are listed below:

Joe | 4258

Mike | 7575

Hannah | 8756

Lauren | 8765

Emma | 7536

Sean | 9898

David | 6556

Aoife | 7865

Alternatively, you can create you own customer account by editing the Access database. 
To do this you must add a Customer row and a corresponding Bank Details row. 
This new bank details row must contain the new Customer ID you created
